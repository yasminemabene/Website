<p> <h1>This is the story I made on Scratch. It is about a guy and girl who go on a camping trip in search for hidden treasure! They get chased by and bear and the guy thinks he ruined the girl's trip. However, in a happy turn of events, they end up recognizing their love for each other and getting married. The bear becomes their officiator. I included different backgrounds for various locations and different costumes for when the characters interact with eachother. Enjoy!  </h1>

           <h1><p>This is the app I made. It is a trivia game on vines which is a 6 second video and an intregal part of Gen Z culture! 
		   Each page has a different vine and players have to fill in the blank with the correct statement.
	 Our project is a trivia game featuring questions regarding the app Vine. Vine is a form of social media where people could upload 6 second videos and share them. Our questions are fill in the blank to popular lines from Vines. 
		   In order to get the answer correct, the player must spell the answer correctly. 
			   We included pictures for each question that correspond with the Vine that it came from. 
			   Our project ended up working but for future improvement we could include a scoreboard, music, and allow people to compete against each other. 
			   I think we could definitely sell this as a product or at least turn it into a monetized website like Kahoot. 
			   Quizzes like these are popular on sites such as Buzzfeed.
